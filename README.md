#Abstract:
It is essential to understand the drivers of variation in tree demography to anticipate how forests will be 
impacted by future climate conditions and disturbance regimes. Studies frequently include abiotic factors, 
failing to account for plant-plant biotic interactions that can have significant impacts on demographic rates. 
We combined data on two prominent environmental gradients, climatic moisture deficit and fire probability, 
with modelled tree functional neighborhoods, to assess variation in survival and growth of tree species in 
the northwestern US. We hypothesized 1) shifts toward increasing functional neighborhood diversity with 
increasing environmental stress, and 2) variation of tree survival and growth in response to the interaction 
of environment and functional neighborhoods. Functional neighborhoods changed along the environmental stress 
gradients, with a shift from less trait-diverse to more trait-diverse neighborhoods as stress increased. Our 
results suggest substantial species variation in survival and growth responses to the combined effects of 
environmental variability and functional neighborhoods. In sum, our findings support that environmental 
variation and biotic interactions jointly determine tree demography. Results of this study offer a different 
perspective of tree species and community responses to variable environmental conditions necessary to better 
anticipate responses to future climate and disturbance changes.
